Instructions to marker
To run the code on timberlea, you need only type: 

python3 ARC.py 

while in the project folder and press enter. From there, the algorithm will run and the resulting scatter plots will be generated and a seperate window will open to display them. These plots will also save as "ArcEq#Plots.png" in the same folder as the python code.

A Scores.txt will be generated that contains the Adjusted Rand Index Scores for each of the clustered datasets.

Finally, individual .csv files will be generated with the naming convention:
<Dataset name>Results.csv

These csv files contain the labels generated by our algorithm alongside the dataset's true labels.
